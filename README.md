# Welcome to Kyler's Online Store

For my phase 3 project I made a fake store where you can buy from a completely
random selection of items.

## Meeting Project Requirements

For the backend of this project, I have a database with 4 sets of data: products,
customers, orders, and order-items. Customers can have many orders, while
products and orders can have multiple order-items.

As a customer, you have the ability to create new orders as well as view, modify,
and cancel previous orders. All changes made are saved in the database.

## It Should be Noted

I don't know how to do any authentication stuff yet. Unlike how an actual online
store would work, you cannot make an account or login on my little project.
When viewing the 'order history' you will see ALL previous orders from ALL
customers. More like a public order history, I guess.

Also, I know this project was mainly focused on the Ruby and Sinatra, but I
happened to get a little carried away with the front end. In fact, I probably
spent the majority of my time on the React side of things. Frontend is just
way more fun :)

I would have kept building onto this project and refined a lot of the messiness,
but I've spent too long on it already and I need to move on.
